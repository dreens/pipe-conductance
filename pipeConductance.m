%PIPECONDUCTANCE Find the conductance of a pipe of arbitrary cross section.
%
%c = pipeConductance(L, pipetype, pipeargs) finds the conductance of a pipe
%   with length L in centimeters, with a cross section of type pipetype, a
%   string specifying the type of cross section, and with parameters
%   varying by pipetype but specified in the pipeargs input.
%
%   pipetype must be one of: circle, square, rectangle, triangle, polygon,
%   annulus, wedge, boundary, image
%
%   In the following, the pipeargs format corresponding to a given pipetype
%   is specified:
%   pipetype -> pipeargs         further description
%    circle      radius
%
%    ellipse     [r1, r2]         either order
%
%    square      sidelength
%
%    rectangle   [length, width]  either order
%
%    triangle	 [a, b, c]        length 3 array of triangle's sidelengths
%
%    polygon     vertices         Nx2 array of vertices of the polygon
%
%    annulus     [r1, r2]         either order
%
%    wedge       [r, angle]
%
%    boundary    boundary         an arbitrary cross section with multiple
%                                 disjoint components or internal
%                                 exclusions, specified as a 1D arraylist
%                                 whose elements are Nx2 arrays, each
%                                 representing a connected component of the
%                                 boundary as a list of ordered points
%                                 along it, with the interior to the right.
%
%    image       {image, pixsize} image is a black and white image of an
%                                 arbitrary cross section, black is the
%                                 pipe interior. pixsize gives the size of
%                                 a single pixel of the image in
%                                 centimeters.
%
% c = pipeConductance(L, pipetype, pipeargs, 'Property', Value) specifies
%   additional arguments as Property, Value pairs. Valid properties are
%   listed below:
%
% 'Mass'    Specify the mass of the gas in AMU. Default is 29, which is the
%           average mass per molecule of "air" by which we mean three parts
%           molecular nitrogen and one part molecular oxygen.
%
% 'Temp'    Gas temperature in Kelvins. Default is 293 (20C, 68F).
%
% 'Gas'     Provide the type of gas as a string. This is just a shortcut
%           for specifying the mass. Valid types: H2, He, Ne, N2, Air, O2,
%           Ar, Kr, Xe, SF6, and many others, all expressed as chemical
%           formulas with capitalization as appropriate from the periodic
%           table.
%
% 'Velocity' Override the gas velocity calculated from temperature and gas
%           mass with your own velocity specified in meters / second. By
%           default, velocity is computed from 'Mass' and 'Temperature'.
%
% 'Density' Specify how many points to break the perimeter into. Default is
%           500. Be careful making this too large, as computation time is
%           cubic in this parameter for non-convex areas. 
%
% 'ViewImage' Default is false. If set true, a figure related to the
%           computation is shown. Will worsen performance, but can
%           be useful for verifying expected behavior for image, polygon,
%           or boundary based cross sections.
%
% 'Units' - Select 'in', 'm', 'mm', 'ft', 'cm' (default) and pipe length
%           and cross sectional parameters will be interpreted in those
%           units. Some other unusual units also implemented.
%
% 'Method'  Choose a specific method to use in calculating conductance. 
%           Can be 'Dushman', 'Knudsen', 'Numeric', or 'Clausing'. The latter
%           is only available for circular pipes, for which it is the
%           default method. Otherwise, 'Dushman' is default. Dushman
%           introduced the notion of considering short pipes as apertures
%           in series with a pipe. The result is exact as pipe shrinks to
%           zero or grows to infinity, and is a reasonable approximation in
%           between. You can specify 'Knudsen' to force the infinite pipe
%           approximation, but keep in mind that this always overestimates
%           conductance, even for rather long pipes. See Lafferty's
%           "Foundations of Vacuum Science and Technology", p 88.
%
%           If 'Numeric' is specified, molecules will be randomly
%           initialzied and propagated ti directly calculate the
%           transmission probability. This can be a slow process and poorly
%           converged for long pipes with low probabilities, in which case
%           'Dushman' is a much better choice.
%
% 'Number'  The number of molecules to initialize for the 'Numeric' Method,
%           see above. Default is 10,000.
%
% Outputs:
% c -       Conductance of the pipe in the rarified gas regime (i.e. dilute
%           molecular flow) measured in Liters / second.

    % That is to say, we want to move the nth block from the diagonal, where n

        xtri(b:e,1:e) = xtri(b:e,[b:e 1:b-1]);

        ytri2(b:e,1:e) = ytri2(b:e,[b:e 1:b-1]);
    end
    
    % Why did we do all that? The four matrices xrep, yrep, xtri, and ytri now
    % represent every possible chord connecting a pair of points in
    % Boundary. For a given pair (i,j), the chord connecting the points
    % (xrep(i,j),yrep(i,j)) and (xtri(i,j),ytri(i,j)) connects the ith point in
    % the Boundary, where i steps through each boundary in Boundary in a
    % clockwise ordered manner, to the point j away, where j steps first
    % through all the points in the same sub-boundary that i is in, beginning
    % the next one clockwise from i, and then through all points in the other
    % sub-boundaries, visiting the sub-boundaries at random but stepping
    % clockwise within each sub-boundary.
    %
    % The 2's are the same, but with a coordinate permutation.

    % We can now get the length of these chords easily:
    chlen = sqrt((xtri - xrep).^2 + (ytri - yrep).^2);

    % We can also get the angle they make with the x-axis:
    chang = atan2(ytri-yrep,xtri-xrep);
    chang2 = atan2(ytri2-yrep2,xtri2-xrep2);
    chang3 = atan2(ytri2-yrep,xtri2-xrep);

    % Since the first column of chords connect each point to itself, they have 
    % length zero. The second column represent neighboring chords, which are
    % not really chords but the segments making up the perimeter. The angles in
    % the second column of chang therefore represent the angle of the
    % perimeter with the x-axis. This will be used to find the cosine of the
    % angle of each chord with the normal to the perimeter in the integrand we
    % seek.
    changt = repmat(chang(:,2),1,l) - chang;
    changt2 = repmat(chang2(:,2),1,l) - chang;
    changt = mod(changt,2*pi);
    changt2 = mod(changt2,2*pi);

    % Since the integrand proceeds over angles emanating from each point along
    % the perimeter, we'll want to weight each chord by the angular
    % displacement to the next chord (i.e. a right Reimann sum). We could get
    % this by computing a diff over adjacent columns of the chord angles with
    % the x-axis. Problems would occur along the boundaries of the master chord
    % matrix where chords switch between different sub-boundaries. To address
    % this, we don't use diff, but instead compare relative to the permuted
    % matrix of chords. This ensures that each chord is compared to a chord
    % emanating from the same point and connected to the adjacent point on the
    % same sub-boundary.
    changd = chang - chang3;

    % Now changd should be small but of either sign, and there could be
    % wraparound errors if chords and their neighbors are on different sides of
    % horizontal. We want to make sure we always think of it as small and
    % positive:
    changd = mod(changd,2*pi);
    changd = changd.*(changd<pi) + (2*pi-changd).*(changd>pi);

        % Conveniently, we can reject one class of chords that are outside
        % the area of interest purely based on whether its angle is between the

        % Lets also note which chords intersect an internal exclusion. We do this

        % to choose points along each chord and see if any 'hit' a boolean matrix
        % encoding the invalid region as an area. This should be O(n^2) instead of
        % O(n^3), but I don't know how the overhead compares.
